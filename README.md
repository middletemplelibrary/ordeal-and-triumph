2025 marks eighty years since the end of the Second World War. Using material from the Inn’s Archive and Library collections, this exhibition explores the wartime experience of the Middle Temple and its members. 
<br><br>
At the Inn, members, residents and staff endured an ordeal of blackouts, bombing, shortages and an ever-changing environment, and worked ceaselessly to protect the Middle Temple and its community from danger. 
<br><br>
Countless Middle Templars made their own remarkable contributions to the wider war effort - at home and abroad, in the law, in uniform or civilian dress. The exhibition illuminates a handful of their stories, as well as the presence of members of the Inn at the Nuremberg Trials. 
<br><br>
Below are some of the items it featured.

#### Call to the Bar in the bomb-damaged Hall, Trinity 1941.

#### Revellers on Fleet Street, Victory in Europe Day, 1945 
Victory in Europe was announced on 8 May 1945, following the surrender of Nazi Germany, triggering widespread jubilation. This photograph shows the celebrations on nearby Fleet Street, in which members, residents and staff of the Inn no doubt took part.

# Preparations for War
<br><br>
As the international situation became increasingly perilous in the late 1930s, the expectation of war spread, and soon preparations were afoot across the land, including at the Inn. In 1938 a committee was appointed to ‘consider protection against air attack’ and the Surveyor was instructed to prepare air raid shelters. While the Munich Agreement of 1938 offered a brief reprieve, by the summer of 1939 war looked inevitable. 
A joint ARP committee with Inner Temple was formed and volunteers sought to act as fire-fighters, wardens, stretcher bearers and first aiders. Instruction was provided on fire-fighting, gas attacks and first aid, and supplies of medicine, equipment and clothing were ordered. Many of the Inn’s prized collections were stored or sent away for safety, including stained glass, paintings, silver and the archives. 
The Second World War began on 1 September 1939, and the Minutes of the Inn’s Parliament on 18 September record that: “Master Treasurer reported that the Air Raid Precautions arrangements were complete”. The Standing Orders were suspended, dining terms cancelled and the whole governance of the Inn left in the hands of a Special War Committee of three Benchers. 
<br><br>

#### ARP Training Notice, 1939
This notice advertises courses of instruction for Air Raid Precautions volunteers, including first aid, fire-fighting and anti-gas training, the latter provided by H.A.C. Sturgess, the Inn’s Librarian.

#### Lists of equipment and medical supplies, 1939
These documents offer an insight in the detailed preparations for war at the Inn. Equipment required for the many ARP volunteers included service respirators, whistles and “Tin-hats for everyone”. Medical needs would be met with biniodide antiseptic, gauze, aspirin, smelling salts and bed pans.

#### Letters regarding availability during the Long Vacation, 1939
On 18 July 1939 a note was sent to Middle Temple residents asking for their movements during August and September, “in order to provide for possible emergencies during the Long Vacation”, so that the ARP committee might make arrangements for the duties of those available. 
Most respondents readily agreed to assist, though some noted the likelihood of their being called up for military service, and one noted (by postcard) that he was unlikely to be returning from France in the near future.

#### Memorandum regarding the transfer of the 1608 Letters Patent and other records, 1939
Shortly before the start of the war, the 1608 Letters Patent issued by James I which granted the lands of the Temple to the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple, was inspected and then packed up. It was then sent, alongside the archives of the Inn, to the care of Master Wintringham Norton Stable, who had offered to house these treasures in his home at Plas Llywn Owen in Montgomeryshire, Wales. 
They were later moved to the nearby medieval church of St Mary at Llan, near Llanbrynmair. A small notice in the Church today records that it played host to these collections for the duration of war.

# Blackout
<br><br>
The outbreak of war was followed by a cold, snowy winter and the enforcement of the Blackout across London. The fear of night air bombing attacks led to strict regulations, in force from 1 September 1939, calling for windows and doors to be covered at night to prevent the escape of any light which might aid enemy aircraft. 
The Inn was no exception to these rules, and ARP wardens patrolled the Temple by night, identifying violations - of which there were many. 
<br><br>

#### Volume recording Blackout Violations, 1940-1941
This volume reports breaches of blackout regulations in the Temple and action taken, and remarks and complaints by shelter marshals. 

#### Notice Regarding Blackout Violations, 1939
This notice reminds residents of the importance of adhering to Blackout regulations, and notes the necessity of taking steps to extinguish lights around the Temple.
