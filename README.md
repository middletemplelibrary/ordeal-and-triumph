2025 marks eighty years since the end of the Second World War. Using material from the Inn’s Archive and Library collections, this exhibition explores the wartime experience of the Middle Temple and its members. 
<br><br>
At the Inn, members, residents and staff endured an ordeal of blackouts, bombing, shortages and an ever-changing environment, and worked ceaselessly to protect the Middle Temple and its community from danger. 
<br><br>
Countless Middle Templars made their own remarkable contributions to the wider war effort - at home and abroad, in the law, in uniform or civilian dress. The exhibition illuminates a handful of their stories, as well as the presence of members of the Inn at the Nuremberg Trials. 
<br><br>
Below are some of the items it featured.

# Middle Temple at War, 1939-1945

#### ‘Middle Temple Ordeal: Being an Account of what World War II Meant to the Inn’, 1947
This volume, compiled by Kathleen Woodward, a member of the Inn and a writer, tells the story of the Inn’s experience of the Second World War. It was based on a wealth of first-hand accounts and recollections from members, residents and staff of the Middle Temple, many of which survive in their original form in the archive.

# Preparations for War
<br><br>
As the international situation became increasingly perilous in the late 1930s, the expectation of war spread, and soon preparations were afoot across the land, including at the Inn. In 1938 a committee was appointed to ‘consider protection against air attack’ and the Surveyor was instructed to prepare air raid shelters. While the Munich Agreement of 1938 offered a brief reprieve, by the summer of 1939 war looked inevitable. A joint ARP committee with Inner Temple was formed and volunteers sought to act as fire-fighters, wardens, stretcher bearers and first aiders. Instruction was provided on fire-fighting, gas attacks and first aid, and supplies of medicine, equipment and clothing were ordered. Many of the Inn’s prized collections were stored or sent away for safety, including stained glass, paintings, silver and the archives. The Second World War began on 1 September 1939, and the Minutes of the Inn’s Parliament on 18 September record that: “Master Treasurer reported that the Air Raid Precautions arrangements were complete”. The Standing Orders were suspended, dining terms cancelled and the whole governance of the Inn left in the hands of a Special War Committee of three Benchers.
